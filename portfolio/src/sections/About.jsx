        <p>
          I’m a Software Engineering graduate from LUT University, Finland, with a strong passion for Full Stack Web Development. I build responsive, scalable web applications using React, Node.js, and MongoDB. I’m also continuously learning technologies like Java and Python to grow further as a full stack developer.
        </p>

        <p>
          My experience spans academic research, personal projects, and continuous learning through online courses. I enjoy writing clean code, crafting seamless user interfaces, and building reliable backend systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm always excited to explore new technologies and work in collaborative teams where I can grow while delivering real value. Beyond coding, I love traveling, word puzzles, and understanding human behavior.
