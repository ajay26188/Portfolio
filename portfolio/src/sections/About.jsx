        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
        I'm a motivated software engineering graduate with a strong interest in developing client- and user-friendly software. I've been learning full-stack development on my own through personal projects and open online courses, exploring how to build and manage everything from the front end to the back end and databases. 
        </p>

        <p>
        I enjoy writing clean, efficient code and creating solutions that are practical and easy to use. I'm eager to keep learning new technologies and grow as a full-stack developer.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          Outside of coding, I enjoy travelling, playing word puzzles and have always been curious about exploring human behavior.
